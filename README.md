## 💡 Why LinguaAid?

Millions of immigrants and refugees receive critical documents — eviction notices, hospital instructions, government letters — in a language they don't speak. Misunderstanding these can have life-altering consequences.

**LinguaAid** doesn't just translate. It explains what the document means, what actions are needed, and flags anything urgent — in the user's language.

---

## 🥚 Easter Egg

**Highlight any word or sentence** on the results page and a translation popup appears instantly — translate it to any language, on the fly. No need to re-upload. Just select and go.

---

## 🌍 Powered by Lingo.dev

All translations are handled by **[Lingo.dev](https://lingo.dev/)** — a high-performance, context-aware translation engine that goes beyond word-for-word. It preserves the legal and medical nuance in critical documents and supports 50+ languages, including underserved ones like Tigrinya, Hmong, and Pashto.
